Hi, I am Lorenzo and I am a Software Engineer based in Minneapolis. My current role is at Medtronic as a Senior Software Engineer specializing in virtual infrastructure, CI/CD, automation, and the software release process. 
I have previously worked in the mobile development space on patient and clinician applications that interact and configure medical devices.

I enjoy diving in and and gaining understanding of complex problem spaces and leading my team to elegant, automated solutions. 
My toolbox contains - among other things - Git, Terraform, Packer, Ansible, Bash, Docker, Java, Go, Python, YAML, and JSON.

Outside of work I enjoy competitive Powerlifting and Strongman, caring for and training my dogs, and video games. I find immense joy in the quest for mastery.
