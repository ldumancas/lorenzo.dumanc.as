Hi, I am Lorenzo and I am a Software Engineer based in Minneapolis. I enjoy developing a comprehensive understanding of complex problem spaces and leading my team to elegant, automated solutions. 
My toolbox contains - among other things - Git, Terraform, Packer, Ansible, Bash, Docker, Java, Groovy, and Go.

My current role is at Medtronic as a Senior Software Engineer specializing in virtual infrastructure, automation, configuration management, CI/CD, and dependency management in the software supply chain. I have previously worked in the mobile development space on patient and clinician applications that interact and configure medical devices.

Outside of work I enjoy competitive Powerlifting and Strongman, caring for and training my dogs, video games, and building custom keyboards. For me, the quest for mastery sparks joy.
